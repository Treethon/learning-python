(COMPLETED) Phase 0: Setup (1 evening — do not skip)

Goal: Eliminate friction.

Install Python 3.11+

Install VS Code

Install VS Code Python extension

Learn only:

How to run a .py file

How to read terminal output

Resource (do only this):

VS Code Python Tutorial (official)
→ Stop once you can run a file and see output


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 1: Core Python (2–3 weeks)

Goal: Internalize fundamentals without drowning.

Primary Resource (do this, in order):

📘 Book (free): Automate the Boring Stuff with Python
https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc

Chapters 1–6 ONLY

Ignore:

Regex chapter

Web scraping

Excel/PDF/email automation

👉 This book works because it explains why things work, not just syntax.

How to use it (critical):

Type all code yourself

After each chapter, write one small script from scratch

Do NOT read ahead

Reinforcement (parallel, light use):

🎥 CS50P – Introduction to Programming with Python

Watch lectures 1–5 only

Skip problem sets if you want; they’re optional

Checkpoint to advance:
You can write:

A loop that processes a list

A function that returns a value

A script that reads input and prints output
without copying examples.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 2: The “Stuck Zone” Cure (4–6 weeks)

This phase matters more than all others combined.

Primary Resource:

📘 Book: Python Crash Course (2nd Edition) by Eric Matthes

Do ONLY:

Part I (Basics)

Skip classes chapter on first pass if needed

This book is excellent at:

Explaining errors

Building intuition

Avoiding abstract nonsense too early

Mandatory Practice Resource:

🧠 Exercism – Python Track

Do Exercises 1–15

Ignore mentor feedback initially

Focus on finishing, not elegance

Why Exercism works:

Forces blank-page coding

Problems are small

You get stuck safely

Debugging Skill (non-negotiable):

🎥 “How to Debug Small Programs” – Corey Schafer (YouTube)
Watch once. Rewatch when stuck.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 3: One Direction Only (4 weeks)

Pick ONE track. Do not hedge.

Option A: Automation / Practical Scripting (most successful for repeat learners)

Resources:

Finish Automate the Boring Stuff:

Files

CSV

Web requests

Corey Schafer: “Python OS Module” & “Pathlib”

Project (required):

A script that:

Reads files

Transforms data

Writes output

Option B: Data Analysis

Resources:

Python for Data Analysis (Wes McKinney)

Chapters 1–6 only

Kaggle: “Python” micro-course

Project:

Load CSV

Clean data

Produce summary stats

Option C: Web (Backend Only)

Resources:

Corey Schafer Flask Series (first 6 videos)

Flask official “Quickstart”

Project:

One CRUD-style app

No frontend frameworks


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 4: Lock It In (Ongoing)

Resource:

“Effective Python” by Brett Slatkin (read slowly)

Habit:

Revisit old code

Improve one thing

Write comments explaining why

What This Path Explicitly Avoids (on purpose)

❌ LeetCode
❌ “100 Days of Python”
❌ Django
❌ Advanced OOP
❌ Async / threading
❌ Watching without coding

These derail repeat learners.

Why This Has a Higher Success Rate

Minimal choice → less cognitive fatigue

Forces blank-page work early

Delays abstraction until intuition exists

Emphasizes finishing over brilliance
